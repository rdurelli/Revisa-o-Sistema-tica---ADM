\underline{Background:} Software modernization is critical for organizations that need cost-effective solutions to deal with the rapid obsolescence of software and the increasing demand for new functionality.  In this context, the Object Management Group (OMG) promotes the Model Driven Development (MDD) concept and proposes the Architecture Driven Modernization (ADM) approach for model-based platform migration, which contains a set of standard representations of views on existing software systems. \underline{Objectives:} To conduct a systematic review study of the literature describing research into Architecture Driven Modernization. \underline{Research method:} We undertook a systematic review study of the literature based upon searching of major electronic databases. \underline{Results:} We selected  \textbf{x} and classified by their contribution, Architecture Driven Modernization process implementation, type and date of publication. \underline{Conclusion:} As a result, the review identified that there are still gaps in the modernization process. Furthermore, the results can provide insights for new research in the modernization area for investigating and defining new tools/process to assist the modernization of system
