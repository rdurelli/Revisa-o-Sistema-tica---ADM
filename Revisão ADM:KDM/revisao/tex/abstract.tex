\underline{\textbf{Background:}} Software modernization is critical for organizations that need cost-effective solutions to deal with the rapid obsolescence of software and the increasing demand for new functionalities. Nowadays, OMG (Object Management Group) has proposed the Architecture Driven Modernization (ADM) an approach for model-based platform modernization, which contains a set of standard metamodels. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is not literature review available in this field. Thus, we argue that there is an essential need for evidence-based body of knowledge about different aspects of the adoption of ADM.
\underline{\textbf{Objective:}} Is to carry out a systematic review study of the literature describing research into ADM. \underline{\textbf{Method:}} A systematic review based on searching of major electronic databases was undertaken. \underline{\textbf{Results:}} We identified 30 primary studies and classified by their contribution, focus area and research type. Among these studies we found out a set of process and tool to aid the ADM. \underline{\textbf{Conclusion:}} ADM has become a popular approach for modernizing legacy systems by means of MDD. There is an overall positive perception about this approach. The findings of this paper provides interesting insights into different aspects of ADM. We expect that the findings can provide valuable information to readers on what can be expected from applying ADM and its metamodels to modernize a legacy systems. Furthermore, the results can provide percetion of new research in the modernization area for investigating and defining new tools/process to assist the modernization of legacy system.
